## Description
This repository contains the work completed during the CodeAlpha internship program.

### Credit Scoring Model
The credit scoring model was built using two algorithms: Random Forest and XGBoost (XGB). The performance metrics are as follows:

- **Random Forest (RF)**:
  - Accuracy: 77%
  - Log Loss: 56%

- **XGBoost (XGB)**:
  - Accuracy: 70%
  - Log Loss: 66%

The model was trained on a dataset containing 100,000 records. The Random Forest model outperformed XGBoost in terms of accuracy.
### Autism Prediction Model
The Autism Prediction Model was built using two algorithms: Logistic Regression and Support Vector machine. The performance metrics are as follows:

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**:
  - Accuracy: 87%
  - Precision: 69% A

- **Support Vector Machine(SVM)**:
  - Accuracy: 81%
  - Precision: 80% 

The model was trained on a dataset containing 800 records. The Logistic Regression model outperformed Support Vector Machine in terms of accuracy.
