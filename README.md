### Credit Scoring Model
The credit scoring model was built using two algorithms: Random Forest and XGBoost (XGB). The performance metrics are as follows:

- **Random Forest (RF)**:
  - Accuracy: 77%
  - Log Loss: 56%

- **XGBoost (XGB)**:
  - Accuracy: 70%
  - Log Loss: 66%

The model was trained on a dataset containing 100,000 records. The Random Forest model outperformed XGBoost in terms of accuracy.
