## Description
This repository contains the work completed during the CodeAlpha internship program.

### Heart disease Prediction
The Heart disease Prediction Model was built using four algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression . The performance metrics are as follows:

- **Random Forest**:
  - Accuracy: 65.2%

- **Gradient Boosting**:
  - Accuracy: 65.7%

- **Support Vector Machine **:
  - Accuracy: 58%

- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Accuracy: 48%

The model was trained on a dataset containing 919 records. The Gradient Boosting model relatively outperformed than other Support Vector Machine in terms of accuracy.
